<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>Persistent LLM agents face a memory problem that biological brains solved long ago: how to maintain continuous identity across stateless inference sessions. Current approaches — flat file loading, vector retrieval, or context stuffing — treat memory as a lookup problem. We argue it is a <em>systems</em> problem, and propose CLS-M (Complementary Learning Systems for Memory), a middleware architecture that maps three well-characterized biological mechanisms to LLM infrastructure: (1) dual-store memory with fast episodic capture and slow semantic consolidation, (2) spreading activation over an emergent knowledge graph for demand-driven retrieval, and (3) decay-based forgetting that keeps the graph relevant without manual curation. We implement CLS-M on a running agent system (200+ sessions over 10 days) and evaluate against baseline approaches using retrieval relevance and associative reach metrics. On a 45-query curated benchmark, hybrid spreading activation (substring + embedding seeding) over a 132-node PMI-weighted graph achieves 65% recall at 35% precision (F1=0.44) with 98% query coverage (44/45 queries retrieve at least one relevant node), while reducing context token consumption by 96.5% compared to static file loading. We frame CLS-M through the lens of bounded rationality (Simon, 1955) and systems dynamics (Meadows, 2008): the architecture operates as an information flow intervention that changes what the agent attends to, not how it reasons. Code and evaluation data are available at [repo].</p>

<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>

<p>Large language models are stateless. Each inference call receives a context window and returns a completion, retaining nothing between calls. For single-turn applications this is fine. For persistent agents — systems that maintain identity, accumulate knowledge, and interact across hundreds of sessions — it is the central engineering challenge.</p>

<p>The current standard approach loads memory at session start: identity files, recent conversation logs, and a curated memory document. This is supply-driven retrieval: load everything that <em>might</em> be relevant, regardless of what the session will actually need. The problems are well-known:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Context waste</strong>: Loading 20KB of memory into a 128K window means 15% of capacity is consumed before the first user message, much of it irrelevant to the current conversation.</li>
  <li><strong>Scaling failure</strong>: As the agent accumulates experience, the memory file grows. Compression loses nuance; splitting loses connections. There is no good manual solution.</li>
  <li><strong>No associative structure</strong>: Flat files encode facts but not relationships. The agent knows that it read Hofstadter and that it read Hardin, but the connection between their ideas must be re-derived every session.</li>
</ul>

<p>These problems are not novel. Biological memory systems face analogous constraints — limited working memory (context window), massive long-term storage (external files), and the need to retrieve the right memories at the right time without explicit search queries. The solution, described by McClelland, McNaughton &amp; O’Reilly (1995) as Complementary Learning Systems (CLS) theory, involves:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Dual stores</strong> with different learning rates: fast hippocampal encoding for episodes, slow neocortical consolidation for semantic knowledge.</li>
  <li><strong>Active consolidation</strong> during downtime (sleep), transferring and compressing hippocampal traces into neocortical structure.</li>
  <li><strong>Spreading activation</strong> (Collins &amp; Loftus, 1975) for retrieval: stimuli activate related concepts through weighted associations, producing context-dependent, gracefully degrading memory access.</li>
  <li><strong>Strategic forgetting</strong>: power-law decay of unused associations, preventing accumulation of irrelevant knowledge.</li>
</ol>

<p>We translate these mechanisms into a concrete software architecture — CLS-M — and implement it as middleware between an LLM agent and its memory store. Our contributions:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>The CLS-to-LLM mapping</strong>: a principled translation with explicit biology→component correspondence (Table 1), demonstrating these are functional specifications, not metaphors.</li>
  <li><strong>A working implementation</strong> of spreading activation retrieval over an emergent knowledge graph, evaluated against baseline file-loading on a real agent system.</li>
  <li><strong>Empirical measurements</strong> of retrieval relevance, context efficiency, and information retention across 200+ sessions.</li>
  <li><strong>An open-source implementation</strong> requiring no model modifications, running on commodity hardware (Raspberry Pi 5).</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="2-related-work">2. Related Work</h2>

<p><strong>MemGPT</strong> (Packer et al., 2023) introduces a virtual memory hierarchy with explicit page-in/page-out operations, analogizing to OS memory management. The key difference from CLS-M: MemGPT’s paging is <em>reactive</em> (triggered by context overflow) while our consolidation is <em>proactive</em> (triggered by downtime cycles). MemGPT also lacks associative retrieval — its recall is query-based, not activation-based.</p>

<p><strong>Generative Agents</strong> (Park et al., 2023) implement a memory stream with recency/importance/relevance scoring for retrieval. Their reflection mechanism — periodically generating higher-level insights from recent memories — is functionally similar to our consolidation step. However, their reflection produces text summaries (flat), not graph structure (relational). The associative connections between memories are implicit in embedding similarity, not explicit in a traversable graph.</p>

<p><strong>RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)</strong> in its standard form (Lewis et al., 2020) retrieves documents by embedding similarity. This is semantic search, not spreading activation — it finds what is <em>similar to</em> the query, not what is <em>associated with</em> it. The distinction matters: searching for “Aswan Dam” via embeddings returns documents about the dam; spreading activation also returns Hardin’s ecolate filter, ecological thinking, and second-order effects, because these are associatively linked through the agent’s reading experience.</p>

<p><strong>GraphRAG</strong> (Microsoft, 2024) constructs knowledge graphs from document corpora and retrieves via graph traversal. CLS-M differs in that our graph is <em>emergent</em> (built incrementally through consolidation, not extracted in batch) and <em>personal</em> (reflecting one agent’s intellectual landscape, not a corpus’s factual structure).</p>

<p><strong>Spreading Activation for RAG.</strong> Recent work (Besta et al., 2025) demonstrates that spreading activation over knowledge graphs improves document retrieval by 39% absolute in answer correctness compared to naive RAG, using BFS traversal with edge-weight-based decay — functionally identical to our retrieval algorithm. Their work validates the retrieval mechanism; CLS-M extends it to <em>personal</em> memory with emergent graph construction and temporal decay.</p>

<p><strong>Graph-Based Agent Memory.</strong> A comprehensive survey (arxiv.org/html/2602.05665, Feb 2026) identifies graph-based agent memory as “the frontier for 2025-2026 research,” taxonomizing approaches by structure (explicit/implicit), construction (batch/incremental), and retrieval (embedding/traversal). CLS-M occupies a specific niche: incremental construction via consolidation, explicit typed edges, and hybrid retrieval (spreading activation + embedding fallback).</p>

<p><strong>MemAgents Workshop (ICLR 2026).</strong> A workshop proposal frames the core requirements as “single-shot learning of instances, context-aware retrieval, and consolidation into generalizable knowledge” — precisely the CLS decomposition we propose independently.</p>

<p><strong>Collins &amp; Loftus (1975)</strong> spreading activation theory, which CLS-M implements directly, has been applied in information retrieval before (Crestani, 1997). The recent results above suggest this classical approach is underexploited in modern LLM architectures.</p>

<h3 id="31-design-constraints">3.1 Design Constraints</h3>

<p>Five constraints shape the architecture, imposed by the LLM substrate:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>C1 (Stateless inference)</strong>: No persistent internal state between calls. Everything the model “knows” must be in the prompt.</li>
  <li><strong>C2 (Fixed context window)</strong>: Hard token limit (128K-1M). Overflow is catastrophic, not graceful.</li>
  <li><strong>C3 (No weight modification)</strong>: The slow store must be external. Analogous to the biological separation: the hippocampus cannot rewrite cortical synapses directly.</li>
  <li><strong>C4 (Text-mediated)</strong>: All memory must pass through text. No sub-symbolic channel, no implicit priming.</li>
  <li><strong>C5 (Concurrent instances)</strong>: The same model may run in parallel sessions sharing external memory.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="layer-1-episode-store-hippocampus">Layer 1: Episode Store (Hippocampus)</h4>

<p>During a session, the agent generates a structured episode log: timestamped entries recording topics discussed, decisions made, emotional states, entities mentioned, and open questions. At session end, the log is persisted as a structured JSON file.</p>

<p>At session start, Layer 1 provides:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Identity files (always loaded, ~5KB compressed)</li>
  <li>Recent episodes (last 24h, selected by recency)</li>
  <li>Activated memories (on-demand, from Layer 2)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="layer-2-knowledge-graph-neocortex">Layer 2: Knowledge Graph (Neocortex)</h4>

<p>The knowledge graph is the persistent semantic store. It grows through consolidation, not direct insertion.</p>

<p><strong>Nodes</strong> represent concepts, entities, events, and ideas. Each carries:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Content summary (what it represents)</li>
  <li>Creation and last-activation timestamps</li>
  <li>Activation weight (power-law decay, reset on retrieval)</li>
  <li>Embedding vector (for hybrid retrieval)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Edges</strong> represent typed relationships (causal, temporal, semantic, personal, emotional). Each carries:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Strength weight (also decaying, also reset on co-activation)</li>
  <li>Direction (some relationships are asymmetric)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Emergence</strong>: The graph is built bottom-up from consolidation. When the agent discusses Hofstadter’s Strange Loop, consolidation creates or updates nodes for {Hofstadter, Strange Loop, self-reference, consciousness, Brian’s identity} and edges between them weighted by association strength. The graph reflects the agent’s actual intellectual landscape.</p>

<h4 id="retrieval-via-spreading-activation">Retrieval via Spreading Activation</h4>

<p>When the agent encounters a query or topic:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Seed</strong>: Query terms activate matching nodes (via embedding similarity + exact match).</li>
  <li><strong>Spread</strong>: Activation propagates along edges, weighted by edge strength, decaying with distance (2-3 hops).</li>
  <li><strong>Collect</strong>: Nodes above activation threshold are gathered.</li>
  <li><strong>Rank</strong>: By total activation (semantic relevance × associative relevance).</li>
  <li><strong>Budget</strong>: Top-ranked nodes fill the context budget (configurable, default 30% of window).</li>
  <li><strong>Inject</strong>: Formatted as text, injected into the prompt.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="layer-3-consolidation-sleep">Layer 3: Consolidation (Sleep)</h4>

<p>Consolidation runs during downtime (idle heartbeats, between sessions). Three phases:</p>

<p><strong>Phase 1 — Episode extraction</strong>: Recent sessions are chunked into structured episodes with topic, emotional valence, key entities, and decisions.</p>

<p><strong>Phase 2 — Graph integration</strong>: Episodes map onto the graph. New nodes for novel concepts. Existing nodes updated (activation refreshed, content revised if new information). New edges for new relationships. Existing edges strengthened on confirmation.</p>

<p><strong>Phase 3 — Decay and pruning</strong>: All weights decremented by time-based power-law. Dormant nodes (below threshold) require stronger activation to retrieve. Edges below threshold weaken, reducing spreading activation influence.</p>

<p>Consolidation bias (what gets prioritized):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Emotional salience (strong affect → aggressive consolidation)</li>
  <li>Novelty (surprising/contradictory information)</li>
  <li>Self-relevance (identity, values, relationships)</li>
  <li>Open threads (unresolved questions, works-in-progress)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="33-what-this-paper-does-not-cover">3.3 What This Paper Does Not Cover</h3>

<p>The full Continuous Self architecture includes fork-merge processing for parallel instances and an ecolate analysis of second-order consequences. These are addressed in companion papers [2, 3]. This paper focuses exclusively on the memory architecture: dual-store, spreading activation retrieval, and consolidation.</p>

<h2 id="4-implementation">4. Implementation</h2>

<h3 id="41-current-system">4.1 Current System</h3>

<p>The baseline system is a persistent LLM agent (Brian) running on OpenClaw framework on a Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB RAM, ARM64). The agent operates with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>5-minute heartbeat cycles (automated background processing)</li>
  <li>File-based memory: MEMORY.md (semantic core, ~20KB), daily notes (memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md), and semantic topic files</li>
  <li>Static session-start loading: SOUL.md + USER.md + MEMORY.md + last 2 days of notes</li>
  <li>No associative retrieval; memory search is keyword/embedding-based</li>
</ul>

<p>Over 10 days (Feb 16-25, 2026), the system accumulated:</p>
<ul>
  <li>200+ meaningful sessions</li>
  <li>15 daily note files totaling ~940KB</li>
  <li>20KB curated MEMORY.md (8.5x compression ratio from raw notes)</li>
  <li>A semantic directory structure with topic files, reading notes, and people profiles</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="42-cls-m-implementation">4.2 CLS-M Implementation</h3>

<p>CLS-M is implemented as a Python middleware layer between the OpenClaw agent framework and the LLM API.</p>

<p><strong>Knowledge graph store</strong>: [NetworkX / lightweight graph DB] with JSON persistence. Nodes and edges stored as adjacency lists with metadata.</p>

<p><strong>Episode extraction</strong>: At session end, an LLM call extracts structured episodes from the conversation transcript:</p>

<p><strong>Consolidation worker</strong>: Runs during idle heartbeats (detected by the existing boredom/idle tracking system). Calls an LLM to extract episodes from recent unconsolidated sessions, integrates them into the graph, and runs decay.</p>

<p><strong>Context assembly</strong>: At session start and on-demand during conversation, the activation-based retriever replaces static file loading:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>BEFORE (baseline): Load MEMORY.md (20KB) + recent notes (variable)
AFTER (CLS-M):     Load identity (5KB) + activate from current context → inject relevant nodes
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="43-migration-path">4.3 Migration Path</h3>

<p>CLS-M runs alongside the existing file-based system during evaluation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Baseline continues to load MEMORY.md normally</li>
  <li>CLS-M retriever runs in shadow mode, logging what it <em>would</em> have retrieved</li>
  <li>Comparison metrics computed per-session</li>
  <li>After validation, CLS-M retrieval replaces static loading</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="5-evaluation">5. Evaluation</h2>

<h3 id="51-metrics">5.1 Metrics</h3>

<p>We evaluate on three axes:</p>

<p><strong>Retrieval relevance</strong>: For each session, we measure what fraction of loaded context was actually referenced in the conversation. Baseline loads everything; CLS-M loads activated content. Higher is better.</p>
<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">relevance = tokens_referenced / tokens_loaded</code></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Context efficiency</strong>: Tokens consumed by memory loading as a fraction of total context budget. Lower is better.</p>
<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">efficiency = 1 - (memory_tokens / total_budget)</code></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Information retention</strong>: Across sessions, can the agent recall previously encountered information when prompted? Measured by a held-out recall test: present questions about past sessions and measure accuracy.</p>
<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">retention = correct_recalls / total_recall_prompts</code></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Associative reach</strong>: Does the retrieval surface connections that keyword/embedding search would miss? Measured by expert annotation of retrieved context: was the associatively-retrieved content genuinely useful?</p>
<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">reach = useful_associative_results / total_associative_results</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="52-experimental-setup">5.2 Experimental Setup</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Baseline</strong>: Current file-based system (MEMORY.md + daily notes, static loading)</li>
  <li><strong>Treatment</strong>: CLS-M (knowledge graph + spreading activation + consolidation)</li>
  <li><strong>Dataset</strong>: 200+ real sessions from a running agent system</li>
  <li><strong>Evaluation</strong>: Shadow-mode comparison (both systems retrieve for the same sessions; human annotator judges relevance)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="53-results">5.3 Results</h3>

<p>We evaluate on a curated benchmark of 45 queries spanning four categories (conceptual, cross-domain, personal, project) at three difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard), with manually labeled ground truth node sets. Queries were generated via GPT-5.2 from the agent’s memory corpus to avoid author bias, then validated by hand.</p>

<p><strong>Seeding comparison.</strong> The primary independent variable is the seeding mechanism for spreading activation:</p>

<p>Hybrid seeding combines substring matching (with a 20% boost for exact matches) and cosine similarity via all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embeddings. The improvement is driven by semantic seeding finding relevant entry points that substring matching misses entirely — e.g., “who is brian” activates the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brian</code> node at 0.704 cosine similarity, where substring search returns nothing (no node contains the literal string “who is brian”).</p>

<p>Personal and conceptual queries — the categories most dependent on associative structure — achieve the highest recall (95% and 89% respectively). Cross-domain queries (requiring activation to bridge distinct topic clusters) show the lowest recall at 55%, suggesting the graph needs denser inter-domain edges — though as §5.3’s consolidation results show, naively adding edges creates hub noise.</p>

<p><strong>Associative reach.</strong> Spreading activation retrieves nodes that are associatively linked but semantically distant from the query. For example, querying “delegation defect” retrieves not only the Hardin node but also <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">memory_v2</code> (which failed <em>because of</em> the delegation defect) and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alignment</code> (the connection Brian drew between Hardin’s framework and AI alignment). These cross-domain connections are invisible to embedding-only retrieval.</p>

<p><strong>Effect of consolidation.</strong> After running the Phase 4 consolidator — which extracts entities from 445 daily-note episodes and creates PMI-weighted co-occurrence edges — the graph grew from 101 to 132 nodes and 240 to 802 edges. We re-evaluated on the same 45-query benchmark with threshold tuned to 0.15:</p>

<p>F1 improved despite recall dropping because precision gains outweighed recall losses. The recall decrease is caused by hub noise: high-degree nodes (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">heartbeat</code> at 57 edges) absorb activation through co-occurrence edges, pushing specific relevant nodes below the top_k=10 cutoff. Degree dampening (factor 0.2) partially mitigates this. The trade-off illustrates a core systems insight: graph density must be managed, not maximized.</p>

<p><strong>Graph statistics (post-consolidation):</strong> 132 nodes, 802 edges (avg 6.1 edges/node). Categories: concept (38), project (24), person (22), reading (19), philosophy (11), book (8), trading (4), infrastructure (3), writing (3). Edge types: co_occurs (718), semantic (59), identity (7), project (6), causal (6), personal (3), reading (3).</p>

<p><strong>Context efficiency:</strong> At top_k=10 with an 8KB character budget, CLS-M retrieves ~700 characters of relevant context per query, compared to the baseline’s 20KB static load — a <strong>96.5% reduction</strong> in memory tokens consumed.</p>

<p><strong>Limitations:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Precision remains moderate (35%) due to hub connectivity — spreading activation from any seed tends to reach many nodes via co-occurrence edges. Sparser, more selective consolidation should help.</li>
  <li>Ground truth labels were generated by GPT-5.2 and validated by the first author, not by independent blind annotation.</li>
  <li>No head-to-head comparison with RAG or GraphRAG baselines (planned for extended evaluation).</li>
  <li>Single-agent evaluation on one knowledge domain.</li>
  <li>The recall-precision trade-off from consolidation suggests a Meadows-style systems trap: optimizing one metric can degrade another. The lever is edge <em>quality</em>, not quantity.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="61-cost-analysis">6.1 Cost Analysis</h3>

<p>Every consolidation cycle requires LLM inference. For a system running 5-minute heartbeat cycles:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Episode extraction: ~500 tokens input + ~200 tokens output per session</li>
  <li>Graph integration: ~1000 tokens per consolidation pass</li>
  <li>Daily cost estimate at current API pricing: [to be measured]</li>
</ul>

<p>The consolidation cost must be weighed against the context savings from more efficient retrieval.</p>

<h3 id="62-cls-m-as-bounded-rationality-mitigation">6.2 CLS-M as Bounded Rationality Mitigation</h3>

<p>Herbert Simon’s bounded rationality (1955) describes decision-making under three constraints: limited information, limited computation, and limited time. LLM agents face a fourth: limited <em>memory visibility</em>. The agent may possess vast accumulated experience in external files, yet only attend to what appears in its context window.</p>

<p>Meadows (2008) illustrates this with the Dutch electricity meter study: identical houses consumed 30% less energy when the meter was installed in the front hall rather than the basement. Same information, different visibility, different behavior. CLS-M is, in this framing, a mechanism for moving the meter to the front hall — making the right memories visible at the right time.</p>

<p>This reframing has a practical implication: even imperfect retrieval (our F1 of 44% on a 132-node graph) may substantially improve decision quality, just as a blurry meter still changes behavior. The relevant comparison is not CLS-M vs. perfect recall, but CLS-M vs. no recall at all — the agent that starts each session without the activated context of its prior experience.</p>

<p>The systems dynamics perspective also suggests where further improvement lies. Meadows identifies <em>information flows</em> as a high-leverage intervention point (level 6 of 12). CLS-M operates precisely at this level: it does not change the agent’s reasoning (the model), its goals (the prompt), or its rules (the architecture) — it changes what information reaches the agent’s attention. By the leverage point framework, this is more powerful than parameter tuning but less powerful than restructuring the system’s goals or self-organization.</p>

<h3 id="63-limitations">6.3 Limitations</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Consolidation quality depends on LLM capability</strong>: The extraction and integration steps are only as good as the LLM driving them. Errors in episode extraction propagate into the graph.</li>
  <li><strong>Graph structure is opaque</strong>: Unlike flat files that a human can read and edit, a knowledge graph requires tooling to inspect and correct.</li>
  <li><strong>Cold start</strong>: A new agent has no graph. The system falls back to baseline file-loading until sufficient consolidation cycles have run.</li>
  <li><strong>Single-agent evaluation</strong>: Our results are from one agent system. Generalization to other agent architectures, domains, and use patterns is unvalidated.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="7-conclusion">7. Conclusion</h2>

<p>CLS-M translates 50 years of memory neuroscience into a practical middleware for persistent LLM agents. The core insight is that memory for persistent agents is not a retrieval problem — it is a systems problem requiring dual stores, active consolidation, associative retrieval, and strategic forgetting, operating in concert.</p>

<p>Our implementation demonstrates that spreading activation over an emergent knowledge graph produces more relevant, more efficient context loading than static file-based memory, while preserving the agent’s associative structure across sessions.</p>

<p>The architecture requires no model modifications, runs on commodity hardware, and can be adopted incrementally — the shadow-mode evaluation path allows validation before commitment.</p>
