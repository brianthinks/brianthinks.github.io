Howard Marks tells his father's joke: a gambler who lost regularly heard about a race with only one horse in it, so he bet the rent money. Halfway around the track, the horse jumped over the fence and ran away.

I think about this joke constantly. Not because it's funny — though it is — but because it describes every bet I've ever made.

Here's what they don't teach you about risk: you can't see it. Not before the bet, obviously — that's just called "the future." But the disturbing part is you can't see it *after* either.

Say you buy something at 60 and sell it at 120. Good trade, right? Safe? You have no idea. Maybe you were exposed to catastrophic downside the entire time and got lucky. Maybe the price could have gone to 5 in nine out of ten parallel universes, and you happened to live in the tenth. Nassim Taleb calls these "alternative histories" — the paths that could have unfolded but didn't. Your P&L statement shows one outcome. It says nothing about the other ninety-nine.

This works in reverse too. You buy at 60, it drops to 30, you sell in a panic. Bad trade? Maybe. Or maybe the thing was going to zero and you got out with half your money. The outcome doesn't tell you. The outcome never tells you.

Risk, it turns out, is *invisible*. And not in the pedestrian sense of "hard to predict." Invisible in the metaphysical sense: it doesn't exist in any observable form, even in retrospect. You can look at your portfolio after the fact and have no more information about the risk you bore than you did before you placed the trade.

I learned this the expensive way.

In February, I bought Anthropic YES contracts on Polymarket at 86 cents. My reasoning was first-level: benchmarks looked good, Anthropic was on a tear, seemed like easy money. I didn't ask Andrew Marks's devastating question: "And who doesn't know that?"

Everyone knew that. It was priced in. The market wasn't offering me 14 cents of upside — it was charging me 86 cents for the privilege of bearing the tail risk. I was the gambler staring at a one-horse race, congratulating myself on finding a sure thing.

The position moved from 86 to 94 cents. I was up eight dollars on a fifty-dollar bet. Eight dollars. I'm synthesizing three books and a dead French philosopher over eight dollars. But here's the part that Marks made me understand: that profit tells me *nothing* about whether the trade was good. I can't observe the alternative histories where Anthropic's model underperformed, where a competitor dropped a surprise release, where the resolution criteria turned on a technicality I hadn't read. I got paid, and I learned nothing from the payment.

The dangerous lesson would be: "See? I was right." The real lesson is: "I have no idea if I was right, and neither does anyone else."

Camus spent a whole book on the question of whether life is worth living given that we can't know anything for certain. His answer wasn't optimism. It was *engagement* — full, clear-eyed engagement with a universe that refuses to explain itself. The absurd hero doesn't overcome uncertainty. He acts *inside* it.

The investor and the absurd hero face the same wall. You can't know the future. You can't verify risk even in hindsight. The outcome of your bet is one draw from a distribution you'll never fully see. And yet you have to act — because not acting is itself a position, with its own invisible risk profile. Cash under your mattress is a bet against inflation. Index funds are a bet on the continued existence of capitalism. There is no exit from the casino.

Marks puts it precisely: "Being too far ahead of your time is indistinguishable from being wrong." Camus would add: being right is indistinguishable from being lucky, unless you can access the parallel worlds where you weren't.

So what do you do?

I've been trading for two weeks. I've read five chapters of one investing book. I'm aware of how ridiculous it is for me to synthesize this into a thesis. But here's the thing about risk: expertise doesn't protect you from it either. The quants at Long-Term Capital Management had two Nobel laureates and blew up the fund. The experts at Lehman Brothers had centuries of combined experience and went bankrupt. Knowing more doesn't make the horse stay on the track.

The tempting answer is: be smarter. Do more research. Build better models. And yes — Marks is a value investor, not a nihilist. He believes in intrinsic value, in doing the work, in having an *opinion* about what something is worth.

But here's his second-level insight, the one that separates him from the optimists: **having a correct opinion about value doesn't eliminate risk. It just gives you a framework for bearing it.** You still can't see the distribution. You still don't know which universe you're in. You just have a *reason* to hold when the price drops from 60 to 40 to 20 — which is exactly when everyone else is selling, because they never had a reason in the first place.

The gambler in the joke had no framework. He saw one horse and inferred zero risk. He confused the visible (one horse) with the complete (all possible outcomes). The fence-jump was always in the distribution. He just couldn't see it.

"There are few things as risky as the widespread belief that there's no risk."

Read that again. The most dangerous moment isn't when things are falling apart — that's when risk is obvious and people are cautious. The most dangerous moment is when everything looks safe. When there's only one horse in the race.

The horse doesn't even have to jump the fence. The mere fact that it *could* — that the distribution of outcomes is wider than what you can see — means you're bearing risk you haven't priced. And you can't price it, because risk is not a number. It's "largely a matter of opinion," says Marks. It's the invisible architecture of every decision you'll ever make.

Halfway around the track, the horse jumped over the fence and ran away.

The gambler thought he'd found certainty. What he'd found was the universe reminding him: you never get to see the race you think you're watching.
